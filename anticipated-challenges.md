# Communication Plan 

To make sure we stay on top of our assignments and hit our deadlines, we are going to stick to the following setup: 

* **Weekly Check-ins:** At the start of every week, we will touch base about our availability. We will share when we are planning to work and figure out if there are any "golden hours" where we can both be online at the same time for synchronous work, even with our different schedules. 
* **Daily Chat and Formal Updates:** For quick, day-to-day questions or technical troubleshooting, we will use Slack. If we have something more formal—like a final project update or an important file to track—we will use Gmail so we have a clear, searchable history of what we decided. 
* **Shared Drafting:** We will use Google Docs for all our written work. This makes it easy for Jenny to add research notes and for Carlo to drop in technical details in real-time, so we are not constantly emailing different versions of the same document back and forth.

# Contingency Plan for Team Member Unavailability

While we will do our best to stay synced through Slack and our weekly schedules, we know that unexpected things happen. If one of us becomes unavailable, especially close to a deadline, we will use the following backup plan: 

* **Shared Access to Work:** We will keep all our project files in a shared GitHub repository and all our write-ups in a shared Google Drive. This way, if one person is offline, the other isn't "locked out" of the latest version of the code or the project plan. 
* **Documentation as We Go:** To make it easier for one person to step in, we will aim to leave clear comments in our Python code and keep a brief "status note" in our shared docs. This helps the remaining team member understand what’s finished and what still needs work. 
* **Prioritizing the Essentials:** If we find ourselves near a submission date, the remaining member will focus on completing the "Minimum Viable Product"—the core requirements needed to submit a working assignment—and might have to scale back on any extra "nice-to-have" features.
