## Biography

Jenny M. Michlich is a graduate student in the School of Complex Adaptive Systems at Arizona State University, where they are
currently taking coursework towards a Master of Science in Complex Systems. Their applied project in this program will focus
on building a multidimensional network graph to better understand the role of physiological signaling for intentional
communication across vertebrate species. Previously, Jenny completed a Master of Arts in the Department of Human
Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, where they were performing research exploring the relationship between plasticity
and adaptation in the structure and function of circuits for the control of facial gestures and vocalization under domestication.
They are interested in neuroethology and understanding the sensory systems of nonhuman animals for communication. Broadly,
They are interested in continuities between human and nonhuman animal systems of communication, along with the
physiological and structural features that support these systems. More recently, they have started to bridge the gap between
production and perception, with research focusing on the facial perception of nonhuman animals as it relates to anthropomorphism
and anthropodenialism.
