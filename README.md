## Project Description:
Murmurings of the replication crisis have been ongoing since the early years of my first undergraduate experience, almost 20 years ago, but this conversation has moved from small meetings in university hallways to public discourse in the academic literature. Science, broadly, has been called out by fellow scholars about the lack of reproducibility of major findings from very prominent scholars and labs to smaller labs meeting problems with full force (Shrout & Rogers, 2018). Effective protocols for coding are one solution to this emerging puzzle for both scientists and humanists alike (Azevedo et al., 2025). Metascience is another emerging field that hopes to address some of these issues (Peterson & Panofsky, 2023). One of our proposals involves providing and developing some simple tools for scientists to move out of correlative studies to studies of modeled causation. Sprites et al., 2000 produced a simple algorithm that has been further expanded for studies in real-world data sets; called the PC algorithm, its implementation aims to develop causal and multilevel network graphs that propose causal mechanisms for complicated and complex systems, when there is more than two variables involved. In this implementation, we hope to model two-variable, three-variable, and four-variable systems while producing publication-ready network graphs that host two levels of organization within the modeled system, as proposed in Gebharter, 2017.
