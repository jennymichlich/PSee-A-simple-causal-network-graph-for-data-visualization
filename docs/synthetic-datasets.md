# Building synthetic datasets for three-variable and four-variable systems

Two synthetic datasets were generated to further test our PSee algorithm. Descriptions of these datasets can be found below.

Three synthetic datasets were generated to illustrate how the structure of causal relationships between variables shapes the statistical patterns we observe in data. Each dataset contains three variables — X, Y, and Z — with the relationships between them constructed according to a different causal architecture. The datasets are designed so that their statistical properties, such as correlations and conditional dependencies, directly reflect the underlying causal structure that produced them, making them useful for studying how well analytical methods can recover or respect those structures.

Four synthetic datasets were generated to illustrate how causal relationships between variables shape the statistical patterns we observe in data. Each dataset contains four variables — X, Y, Z, and W — with the relationships between them constructed according to a different causal architecture. The additional variable expands the complexity of the system, allowing for richer structures such as multiple mediating pathways, layered common causes, or combinations of forks and colliders within the same graph. The datasets are designed so that their statistical properties, such as correlations and conditional dependencies, directly reflect the underlying causal structure that produced them, making them useful for studying how well analytical methods can recover or respect those structures.
