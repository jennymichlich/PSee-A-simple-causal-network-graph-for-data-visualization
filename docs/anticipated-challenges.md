# Anticipated Challenges

Our team members have diverse skills that we believe will complement and benefit this project. **Jenny** is stronger on research, and **Carlo** is stronger on Python coding. However, we anticipate this course will present some challenges, as meeting the assignment requirements would require something new from us.

## Technical Challenges

* **PC Algorithm Implementation:** The core technical hurdle for this project is the successful implementation of the PC algorithm for causal discovery. Because this algorithm involves complex statistical independence tests and graph-edge orientations, getting the logic right will be demanding.
* **Environmental Consistency:** We anticipate challenges in ensuring our computational environment is consistent. Since we will be using the `causal-learn` library, we need to ensure the code runs identically across machines without "version drift" or dependency conflicts. This aligns with the course’s focus on sustainable and maintainable research code.

## Process Challenges

* **Intensive Schedule:** The course structure requires approximately 18 hours of work per week over a 7.5-week period. Our main process challenge will be adhering to the module’s high standards for Sustainable and Maintainable Code while moving at this pace.
* **Quality vs. Speed:** We expect it to be challenging to consistently apply best practices (quality) while working under such a compressed delivery schedule (speed). Balancing these engineering requirements with the actual algorithmic development will be a major focus of our project management.

## Teamwork Challenges

* **Work Integration:** While our team has a good mix of research and coding skills, we anticipate challenges in how we actually integrate our work. 
* **Bottleneck Management:** Because we have different schedules, we need to manage the project so that "bottlenecks" do not occur. We expect to face difficulties designing the software so we can work on different modules (e.g., research-heavy data prep versus the core Python implementation) simultaneously without breaking the main codebase. 
* **Git Learning Curve:** Mastering the use of Version Control (Git/GitHub) to handle these merges smoothly will be a significant learning curve for the team.
